/**
 * Manages the lifecycle of the Angular service worker.
 *
 * `Driver` is a singleton within the worker. It attempts to instantiate a `VersionWorker`,
 * a class that serves fetch (and other) events according to the instructions defined in a
 * particular version of a manifest file. The `Driver` maintains an active `VersionWorker`
 * and routes events to it when possible. A state machine ensures the `Driver` always
 * responds to traffic correctly.
 *
 * A principle consideration for choosing a 'correct' manifest with which to serve traffic
 * is when to switch to a new (updated) version of the manifest. `Driver` is responsible
 * for periodically downloading fresh versions of the manifest from the server, staging
 * a new `VersionWorker` if the manifest has been updated, and deciding when to switch app
 * traffic from the old to the new manifest. A large part of `Driver`'s logic is devoted
 * to this update process.
 *
 * At a high level, updates follow this process:
 *
 * 1) When a new `Driver` is created (worker startup), it initializes into a READY state
 *    and then checks for an updated manifest from the network.
 *
 * 2) If such a manifest is found, the `Driver` creates a new `VersionWorker` and attempts
 *    to set it up successfully, updating files from the old `VersionWorker` currently
 *    serving traffic.
 *
 * 3) If that update is successful, the driver queues the new manifest as staged and
 *    enters an UPDATE_PENDING state.
 *
 * 4) On the next `fetch` event that meets all the criteria for an update, the `Driver`
 *    activates the stage manifest, begins serving traffic with the new `VersionWorker`,
 *    and instructs the old `VersionWorker to clear up.
